      "content": "Short answer: Jupyter Book doesn’t ship LLM-specific interfaces or an API. It’s a static-site tool built on Sphinx. That said, it already produces (or can easily be configured to produce) several machine-friendly artifacts you can expose alongside the human-readable HTML.\n\nWhat you get out-of-the-box or with minimal config\n- Per-page source downloads:\n  - Enable a “Download” button so users (or bots) can fetch the original .md or .ipynb for each page. In _config.yml set html.use_download_button: true. If the source page is a notebook, the download will be the .ipynb; if it’s MyST/Markdown, it will be the .md file.\n  - Enable “View source”/“Edit this page” buttons (html.use_repository_button/use_edit_page_button) so crawlers can follow through to your repo and fetch raw sources via GitHub’s raw endpoints.\n- Search index artifact:\n  - A Sphinx search index is generated with every HTML build (commonly searchindex.js). It contains the page titles/paths and extracted text and can be parsed programmatically.\n  - If you prefer a pure JSON index, add a JSON search extension (e.g., sphinxcontrib-lunrsearch) via the jupyter-book “sphinx.extra_extensions” and serve its JSON file.\n- Alternative builders for structured outputs:\n  - JSON: Build with jupyter-book build PATH --builder json (Sphinx’s serializing-HTML/JSON builder). You’ll get one JSON per page containing metadata and the page body (as HTML), plus a global manifest. Host this directory as a lightweight, read-only “API.”\n  - singlejson: jupyter-book build PATH --builder singlejson for a single aggregated JSON file.\n  - XML: jupyter-book build PATH --builder xml if you prefer Docutils XML.\n  - EPUB/PDF: Also available; useful for bulk ingestion but less structured than JSON/XML.\n- Other machine-consumable artifacts:\n  - objects.inv (Sphinx intersphinx inventory) mapping labels/targets to URLs; can be parsed programmatically.\n  - Sitemap.xml via a Sphinx sitemap extension, helpful for crawlers.\n\nPractical “LLM-friendly” setup pattern\n- Make the source repo public and stable. Prefer MyST Markdown for prose, and keep notebooks present where they add value.\n- Enable the per-page download and repository buttons so raw .md/.ipynb are one click (or one request) away.\n- Produce a JSON build and publish it at a stable path (e.g., /api/json/). Many consumers will find this the most convenient machine format.\n- Expose a JSON search index. If you don’t want to add an extension, document how to parse searchindex.js; otherwise add sphinxcontrib-lunrsearch and serve its JSON.\n- Generate and serve a sitemap.xml to aid discovery.\n\nNice-to-have best practices\n- Pair notebooks with text or script formats via Jupytext so every .ipynb has a .md or .py twin that’s diff- and parse-friendly.\n- Keep pages reasonably sized and semantically structured (clear headings, labels, captions, alt text). Stable slugs and anchors help programmatic linking.\n- Use MyST roles/directives for semantic structure (glossary, equations with labels, code-block language tags). Even if an LLM ingests HTML, this structure survives and improves extraction.\n- If you need a bespoke “API,” add a small post-build step that:\n  - Reads the Sphinx environment or JSON build output,\n  - Emits a compact pages.json manifest (id, title, url, headings, checksum),\n  - Optionally emits plain-text versions of each page (HTML-to-text), and\n  - Publishes all of the above under /api/.\n- Consider hosting datasets referenced in the book in canonical, machine formats (CSV/JSON/Parquet) and link them with explicit download directives.\n\nConfiguration pointers (where to look in Jupyter Book)\n- _config.yml → html.use_download_button, html.use_repository_button, html.use_edit_page_button.\n- _config.yml → sphinx.extra_extensions to add things like sphinxcontrib-lunrsearch or sitemap.\n- jupyter-book build PATH --builder json|singlejson|xml|epub to produce non-HTML artifacts.\n\nBottom line\n- There’s no LLM-specific facility or runtime API in Jupyter Book, but by enabling source downloads, publishing the JSON (or XML) builder outputs, and exposing a JSON search index and sitemap, you can provide clean, programmatic entry points that LLM pipelines can consume reliably.",
