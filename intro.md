# Welcome to the Nested Sampling Book

Complement to the excellent `blackjax` library, and following its pattern of having a sampling book to demonstrate algorithm usage, we introduce the _nested sampling book_, aiming to provide physics motivated use cases focussing on the nested sampling algorithm.
